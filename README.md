Hi, you probably guessed by the theme of the codejam, this is a heath app.
But unlike any other app like Corona trackers and those broing stuff... I tried making an app that people actually love to use... and not just to put in my portfolio.

The UI might look simple but there are lots and lots of features. There is a lot happening in backend.

### Main features:
1. Login and proper user authentication 
2. Blog with comments
3. What section
4. Qna 
5. 1:1 chat with your Consultant. You can become a consultant too
6. Footstep counter (realtime)
7. CRUD for your comments and answers
8. Profile pics
9. Yoga trainer
10. Basic calculators (bmi, calorie calculator)
11. Simple UI but good UX

This is a complete production level app with almost 100% seo optimized.

I had really big ideas for the app but many of them I couldn't complete due to lack of time.
Like importing 3d models for yoga but there were no free models
A facial expression monitor which tells you how much time you were happy and stressed and other expressions.

Like counters.. 
And polish some rough edges.

But exams ruined my plans. I had only half of the time to complete this project.
And if you're from India,  you know how crucial are board exams. Career deciding (as they say). Anyways I would stop complaining now. Maybe I add them in future updates.

Also there are some Easter eggs of other YouTube..  let's see if you can find the.. also don't go to 404 page or else you'll have consequences :|
